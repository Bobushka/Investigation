### Pi_by_Leibniz
The most unefficient way to calculate Pi. It's my first code completed in October 2020.

### unic_words_count 
Script from the "The Quick Python Book" by Naomi Ceder, p.53. Script was updated: the words count by friquency in decsending order an some more tiny things added. It was curious for me to investigate the "Short history of Communist Party" (Iosif Stalin, 1938) by this script.
